1
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,230
This is a huge mess.

2
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,940
Why aren't you here?

3
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,260
Bruce, why does it sound like you're fleeing
the scene?

4
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,360
What kind of.

5
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,720
Idiot kid decided to try to play in the big
leagues, put a crew together and broke into

6
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,910
the lab at Gotham General, Stole a highly
deadly virus, intercepted them to blast their

7
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,760
way out. You can handle the hospital.

8
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,500
Barry, Somebody has to save the rest of the
world.

9
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,970
So I was going to do that, if you don't
mind.

10
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,220
Sounds about right, Bruce.

11
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,950
Thanks for saving me from the sinkhole.

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,040
Flash, Barry.

13
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,500
Gas and water pipes ruptured in the
basement.

14
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,160
Right? On it.

15
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,670
What I've come to accept that I'm essentially
the janitor of the Justice League, which

16
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,040
sucks, but I've come to accept it.

17
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:02,750
But I can't help but notice that it always
seems to be a bat mess that I'm cleaning up.

18
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,890
My calculations are correct.

19
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,050
And history will prove they usually are.

20
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,060
The foundational attacks is about to cause
the collapse of the East Wing.

21
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,680
These wings. Fine.

22
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,640
This is good because my speed is lagging.

23
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,380
Running on empty. Alfred.

24
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,410
You hear that? That's my stomach.

25
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,600
No, no. It's the collapse of wing.

26
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,400
Harry. Dirtiest dog.

27
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,610
Mr. Allen.

28
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,740
You've made me very proud.

29
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,470
And a lot of mothers very happy.

30
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,480
I understand that these events can be
psychologically scarring.

31
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,700
You should seek the services of a mental
health professional.

32
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,390
The Justice League is not very good at that
part yet.

33
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,500
Trust me.

34
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,320
Seek him out.

35
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,650
If that briefcase falls into the water, it
could wipe out half of Gotham by lunchtime.

36
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,490
Don't drop it.

37
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,000
No. Please.No

38
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:08,470
Sorry I'm late.

39
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,830
What just happened?

40
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,880
Hi. Hi.

41
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,660
Nice suit. Looking good.

42
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:53,570
Well.

43
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,540
Thank.

44
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,680
And you.

45
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,920
Are welcome. My ego is far too big to say
thank you

46
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,780
This is about you.

47
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,300
You have to stop living in the past.

48
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,030
Was that fast enough for you?

49
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,040
Now look who's here.

50
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,780
Shut up.

51
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,370
Robert. Every day.

52
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,190
I don't know how you do it.

53
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,290
Harry, would you, like, crawl here, bro?

54
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,010
Is he mad?

55
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,290
You're getting fired.

56
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,160
You're getting murdered. No, no, no.

57
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,430
Let me guess. Your alarm clock didn't go off.

58
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,370
Your dog ate your alarm clock.

59
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Your alarm clock ate your keys.

60
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,350
Your keys. Grandmother died, and they need a
personal day.

61
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,150
None of those things. What was it this time,
Barry?

62
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,640
It was something else.

63
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,440
It was far less outlandish.

64
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,860
And I know I missed the meeting, but I'd
still really like to present these case files

65
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,690
for potential review. Think we rush these
cases?

66
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,000
We need to reopen.

67
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,860
We got a backlog six months deep, and you
want us to move slower?

68
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,690
You need to focus your motion, do the work,
close the case.

69
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,540
Move on. You have a lot of potential, Barry.

70
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,300
You shouldn't still be getting coffee after
all these years.

71
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,700
You're right. That's. That's true.

72
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,550
Go get me a coffee.

73
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,840
Two sugars. Oh, yeah.

74
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,180
You're going to love this ruling.

75
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,870
In the Johnson case, the evidence our lab
analyzed was more than sufficient to be

76
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,060
conclusive. Still working that evidence,
diligence.

77
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,850
Hard work and focus.

78
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,940
Barry was still working on that evidence.

79
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:55,420
Look, if.

80
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:58,780
We're up to you, we'd still be scraping ten
Bundy's molars.

81
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,350
You know what? I'm so happy you find this all
so hilarious.

82
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,580
But we are dealing with real people's lives,
people's families, and I don't think you can

83
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,990
grasp the gravity of that.

84
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,790
So why don't you leave me alone?

85
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,070
Barry Allen. Iris West.

86
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,090
You know my full name also?

87
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,750
Yes.

88
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,540
From school. Oh,

89
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,690
Barry. Tell us, you had a friend from
school.

90
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:20,770
We actually.

91
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,730
Didn't know that Barry had a.

92
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,470
Friend. Yeah. What does that make you now?

93
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,610
One one.

94
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,010
You guys.

95
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,740
Bye. You guys okay?

96
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,590
They're not really my friends.

97
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,520
They're my work friends.

98
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,810
So you work here?

99
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,460
Yes, I do.

100
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,750
It's been a long time, huh?

101
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,480
I feel like we saw each other like a few
years ago, right?

102
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,590
No, because we haven't seen each other since
college.

103
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,210
Maybe I was just thinking about you.

104
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,790
Well, I'm really glad I ran into you.

105
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,400
Yeah. Your father's appeal is small.
right?

106
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:02,530
Yeah. How?

107
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,610
Sorry. How do you know about that?

108
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,230
I'm covering it for the paper.

109
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,230
Oh. How is he holding up?

110
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,190
Um. Are you asking for the paper?

111
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,050
No, I'm asking as a friend.

112
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,380
Oh. Although I'm sure the public would want
to know as well.

113
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,560
Well, my only official comment is that my dad
is innocent, Right.

114
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,690
I mean, no one would want to believe that
their father killed their mother.

115
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,710
What do you mean, believe?

116
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,810
My dad shouldn't be in jail.

117
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,890
My mom should be alive.

118
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,270
It's not about what I believe.

119
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,480
It's about what the truth is.

120
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,060
Right? No, Jess, that's.

121
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,680
Oh, my God. That's what I meant.

122
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,230
Right. Sorry.

123
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,150
I have no official comment at this time.

124
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,750
You have a collect call from the Iron Heights
Penitentiary.

125
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,880
Do you wish to accept?

126
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,340
Yes. Hey, Dad.

127
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,590
Hey. How you doing?

128
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,550
I'm fine.

129
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,560
Are you getting out much? Yeah.

130
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,520
No. No.

131
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,310
But, um, I.

132
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,670
Ran into an old college friend, Iris West,
today.

133
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,170
Didn't you have a.

134
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,640
Monster crush on her?

135
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,840
Well, she had a boyfriend.

136
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,280
Why don't you ask her out?

137
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,750
Dad, I, um.

138
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,660
I had a friend run the old security camera
footage from the store through this new

139
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,380
program he's developed, and it's crystal
clear now.

140
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,240
It's just. You never woke up, Dad.

141
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,760
You can't see your face.

142
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,270
Without new evidence to support your alibi.

143
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,520
We're just going to need to start thinking
about the next appeal.

144
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:00,980
No.

145
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,610
You need to stop worrying.

146
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,690
About your old man.

147
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,820
Do that, you might actually have time for a
girlfriend.

148
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,720
Dad, I don't want done this before.

149
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,230
This was a.

150
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,590
Last ditch effort. And we'll go through the
motions tomorrow.

151
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,720
I'm okay. Really.

152
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,370
You know, sometimes I even think it's
probably easier for me to be in here and out

153
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,830
there without her.

154
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,230
This way, I can.

155
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,580
Imagine she's alive.

156
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,740
Out there, living her life.

157
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,350
Buried there.

158
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,910
Yeah, I'm here, Dad.

159
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,060
Hey, remember that sauce you make on Sundays?

160
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,200
No house. Not like basil tomatoes.

161
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,620
She put on my sweats and starts singing.

162
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,420
And what was that song?

163
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,010
I love that song.

164
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:05,830
Remember that part? It's not fair.

165
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,510
What's not fair, Maggie?

166
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,970
This question is stupid.

167
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,210
How many calculations can you think of with
an answer of 24.

168
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,910
There are bajillion answers.

169
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,240
How are we supposed to fit them all?

170
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,810
You are right. There are a bajillion answers
to this question.

171
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,090
Not every problem has a solution.

172
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,130
Sometimes you just have to let go.

173
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,220
Give your brain a rest and help me make the
pasta.

174
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:33,970
Come on. No, Henry, you're cutting your
meal.

175
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,390
I need you to do me a favor.

176
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,600
Any favors?

177
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,490
Okay. Barry needs you to do him a favor.

178
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,740
Oh, Barry. Yeah.

179
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,980
Anything. I need another can of tomatoes.

180
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,170
You had a can of tomatoes.

181
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,370
I need another one.

182
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,660
I thought you guys went to the store this
morning.

183
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,390
But I forgot the tomatoes.

184
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,660
This looks way more fun.

185
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,700
Let's just let Barry go to the store.

186
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,110
You drive, right? Squirm.

187
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,720
You're so big, you can do anything.

188
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,890
Look at you. You're getting great.

189
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,690
Actually, we can block the blue one.

190
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,230
Okay.

191
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,460
Got it. Blue can.

192
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,750
Not the green one, right?

193
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,410
No.

194
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,150
Not the blue one.

195
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,760
Start singing.

196
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,370
Run! Run!

197
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,250
Barry.

198
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,620
We love you, Mikey.

199
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,300
Love you more.

200
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:41,870
I love.

201
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,770
You first.

202
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,630
Perry. You.

203
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,690
Barry. Barry?

204
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,440
Coll 991

205
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,130
Now.

206
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,750
Yeah. Don't worry about tomorrow.

207
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,590
We always knew it was.

208
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:41,120
A long shot. Dad, your call with Iron Heights
Penitentiary had been terminated.

209
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,600
So you're saying you went back in time like a
bizzare

210
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,530
Yeah, like bizzare

211
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,060
Except bizzare was a stick.

212
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,600
And this time I went back a whole day.

213
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,960
So let's imagine that it is, in fact,
possible for you to run faster than the speed

214
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,830
of light. So doing travel back in time, it's
still would be wildly irresponsible.

215
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,600
I knew you were going to say that. Yes,
because if you were to go into the past, any

216
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,440
interaction you have with your parents or
yourself, you step on the wrong blade of

217
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,680
grass. You have no idea what the
consequences to that could be.

218
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,150
I know the butterfly effect.

219
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,500
Right. Yes, I get it.

220
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,930
But Bruce i could fix things.

221
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,960
You could also destroy everything.

222
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,390
I could save . I could save both of them.

223
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,460
Save your parents.

224
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,560
Race car we have.

225
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,650
Make us who we are.

226
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,400
We're meant to go back and fix them.

227
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,340
And there's nothing broken with you that
needs to be fixed.

228
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,520
Take it from me. Guys made a lot of
mistakes.

229
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,730
Do. Live your past. Live your life.

230
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,520
Don't let your tragedy define you.

231
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,440
But if it's supposed to define me.

232
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,490
The tragedy made you a hero.

233
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,620
Also made me alone.

234
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,270
We could hang out.

235
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,330
Do you want to get a pie?

236
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,170
I'm still hungry.

237
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,490
Not this time. Maybe some other time.

238
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:06,840
Yeah.

239
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,200
Nice ride.

240
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,930
Yeah. Fancy friends?

241
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,510
Yeah, it was an Uber. Zach.

242
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,170
Look, Iris, I really can't talk about the
case at all.

243
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,790
As a reporter.

244
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,440
Can we talk?

245
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,950
Come on in.

246
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:48,260
I'm not gonna lie. It's a lot tidier in.

247
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,370
Here than I expected.

248
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,010
Yeah.

249
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,440
Yeah, well, I'm.

250
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,420
I'm pretty tidy person.

251
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,380
Can I offer you a drink? Sure.

252
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,460
I'll take a beer.

253
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,310
Beers. Beers. Beers.

254
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,630
Keep them in my fridge.

255
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:20,740
Thanks.

256
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,730
Look, I feel really bad about earlier.

257
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,740
I should have been more sensitive.

258
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,310
And I probably could have been less
sensitive.

259
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,400
I mean, I can't imagine what you've been
through.

260
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,060
It's like you lost both parents in one day.

261
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,210
Yeah, I did. I lost my mom to a tragedy, and
I lost my dad to the failures of the justice

262
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,780
system.

263
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,540
Is that why you got into criminal forensics?

264
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,640
To try and fix the system.

265
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,320
Yeah. You had to fix it.

266
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,880
There's got to be a way to fix it, right?

267
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,700
I mean, that's kind of why I got into
journalism, too.

268
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:13,020
I could make it right if I could just go back
somehow and warn them without them knowing

269
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,100
that I'd warn them.

270
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm thinking, like, that's going to drive you
crazy.

271
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,330
If I could just go back in time and stop the
guy who did it.

272
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,070
I can't do that because that's way too much
interaction.

273
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,970
My dad wasn't even at home.

274
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:30,400
My mom sent him to go get a can of tomatoes.

275
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,990
I think whoever broke into the house thought
it was empty.

276
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,880
Then my mom was in there with the knife in
her hand and things went bad.

277
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,650
Just this absurd chain of events.

278
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:42,430
And it's like this footage should have
finally supported my dad's alibi, but

279
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,550
instead, three lives ruined for a can of
tomatoes.

280
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,200
Oh, my God. What?

281
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,310
Well, that could be it.

282
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,910
If my mom doesn't forget the tomatoes in the
first place, then he never leaves and she

283
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,040
never dies. No one would even have to see
me.

284
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,790
Interaction.

285
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,370
This is no interaction. This is just quick
and quick out back to the present.

286
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,170
Like I was never even there and that's how I
fixed it.

287
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,870
Oh, my God. Iris, thank you so much.

288
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,010
This has been great.

289
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,080
Oh, um, I'm sorry.

290
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,300
I have to leave.

291
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,420
Right. I had a really great time, by the
way.

292
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,500
We should do this again.

293
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,000
This is a bad idea.

294
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,550
So you're fast. Your dad.

295
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,390
My mom.

296
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:18,739
You don't forget the tomato.

297
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,220
See you soon.

298
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,800
it works.

299
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,720
Monkey.

300
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,690
What are you wearing?

301
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,970
Is that fairy?

302
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,230
And he's early.

303
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,270
What universe is this?

304
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,689
You cut.

305
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:19,750
Your hair. You can see your eyes.

306
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,770
You look terrible, Henry.

307
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,569
You look beautiful, baby.

308
00:32:24,601 --> 00:32:26,131
What are they doing to you over there?

309
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:28,141
Leave him alone. He's perfect.

310
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:30,509
Come here.

311
00:32:33,841 --> 00:32:35,131
I love you so much.

312
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,369
I love you, too. I love.

313
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:39,650
You more. I loved you first.

314
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,960
Go take a shower and change.

315
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,580
you smell bad

316
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,149
Oh Seriously?

317
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,780
No. I mean, like, mature.

318
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,530
If that is wants to look old, he gets in the
bars that way.

319
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,300
How can I help?

320
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
Mom, how was your day?

321
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,070
Are you a month or the last 18 years?

322
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:08,750
Or is that a weird question?

323
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,919
Because I was here, but obviously we share
those memories together.

324
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,300
Or, I don't know, maybe we make some new
memories.

325
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,259
Like we can go to the aquarium or the circus
or to the the park and you can push me on a

326
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:21,768
swing. That's also weird because I'm an
adult now, so I probably motivate my own

327
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,550
motion on a swing.

328
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:23,749
So how was it this week?

329
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,740
How's school.

330
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:27,378
At school?

331
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,519
Was. Was.

332
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,069
Is good. School's been great.

333
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:34,641
I've just been working really hard there on
my studies.

334
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:36,349
Did you ask out that girl from Econ?

335
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,880
I know freshman year is about going out,
meeting people.

336
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:45,110
Okay. Exploring things, experimenting.

337
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:48,951
But you have to be very careful.

338
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:56,360
Oh, shit. I have to shit outside.

339
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,470
Oh. Why are you here?

340
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,010
What year is it?

341
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,170
My face is still my face.

342
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,030
I think I'm having a mushroom flashback.

343
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:23,009
Is that a thing? How old are you?

344
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:27,060
80. If you.

345
00:34:35,009 --> 00:34:35,909
Whoa.

346
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,519
This is mad. Trippy.

347
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,300
So we're, like, in the future?

348
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,689
No, wait. This is not trippy, dude.

349
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,889
This is catastrophic.

350
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,419
And no, we're not in the future.

351
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:48,450
I was supposed to be back in the present,
but I'm still in the past, and there's not

352
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,680
supposed to be two of me.

353
00:34:49,709 --> 00:34:53,158
You and I are not supposed to be occupying
the same reality at all, let alone

354
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:59,669
interacting. We have a super hero who time
travel, though like you are not anything

355
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,110
which is good. You don't want to be a
superhero.

356
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,940
It's scary. And get a bug splatter in my
teeth all the time.

357
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,730
Awesome. Hey, do the thing again.

358
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,980
No, we don't have time.

359
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,568
Mom. Um.

360
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,830
What are you doing? You're going to tattle
now?

361
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,650
The thing. Fine.

362
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,180
Oh, yeah. Abby.

363
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,190
Yeah. Now, now, undo it.

364
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:50,831
We're fine. I'm fine.

365
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,340
So do you have, like, a plane that that goes
underwater or, like, a boat that can fly it?

366
00:35:57,761 --> 00:35:59,021
How old are you? Like 40.

367
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,960
Okay, you don't stop talking.

368
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,289
It's not charming.

369
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,389
It's abrasive and exhausting and.

370
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,990
Oh, my God. I am starting to realize what
people mean.

371
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,059
Just do me a favor and promise me that
meeting me isn't going to screw up space

372
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:14,921
time. Broski.

373
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,060
I got you.

374
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,680
Shit, I'm in so much trouble.

375
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,130
What do you mean.

376
00:36:20,601 --> 00:36:23,390
What can i do? I can drug you.

377
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:23,721
Yes

378
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,669
Yeah,I can drug

379
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,789
You. And then you pass out and wake up and
you forget that anything ever happened.

380
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,510
And it wouldn't be wrong. Right? Because
you're me.

381
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,180
No, we shouldn't.

382
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,280
Please don't drug me.

383
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,909
No, no, Because here's the thing.

384
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,919
And I thought about it before. Don't want to
be drugged, but I'm sure we can think of a of

385
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,110
a of another way.

386
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:43,640
Let's put on our Barry thinking caps and
think of a different.

387
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,920
Solution for for memory loss.

388
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,749
Also I'm a I'm a green belt in in Europe and
an extensively.

389
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:54,349
Studied wrestler and I can just go freaking
lunatic on you.

390
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,600
Besides, I have a date tonight.

391
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,720
Okay. Where do you have to get someone to
make them forget stuff?

392
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:04,459
Hit you in the past would hurt me in the
future.

393
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,580
Wait, you.

394
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,870
You have a date tonight? What are you doing?

395
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:13,971
Nothing. Who's your date with this super
babe in my econ class?

396
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,219
Iris West. Oh, my God.

397
00:37:16,221 --> 00:37:17,301
Do we marry her?

398
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,979
You're going on a date with her tonight.

399
00:37:18,981 --> 00:37:21,111
That's why I need Mom to do my laundry.

400
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,460
You could do your own laundry.

401
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,490
Do you?

402
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,240
Okay. I'm actually going to go.

403
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,890
What do you mean? Enjoy your life?

404
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,239
Do you change?

405
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,320
Literally nothing.

406
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:32,698
I'll see you again. Never.

407
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,339
I have a few more questions, though.

408
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,510
We have so much to learn from each other.

409
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:39,691
Great. You're leaving me.

410
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:41,821
And now the storm is gonna ruin my day.

411
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:44,101
What day is it today?

412
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:51,019
But they know the date.

413
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,800
It's December 29th.

414
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:58,488
Oh, shit. The storm.

415
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,510
This is the day.

416
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,720
What day do I got my powers?

417
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,899
The day you get your powers.

418
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,360
Powers? Listen.

419
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,949
I can't tell you why I travel back in time,
and I can't tell you what I changed.

420
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,749
But essentially, in my version of reality, I
ended up interning at the Central City Crime

421
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,070
lab in my freshman year.

422
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,710
That's where it happened.

423
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,039
Happens tonight, September 29th, the
accident that gives me my powers.

424
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,331
And if you're not there.

425
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:30,850
30 minutes and you won't get the powers.

426
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,910
Which means I don't get the powers.

427
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,289
Maybe. And then that would mean that I lose
my way of getting back in time in the first

428
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:41,139
place. And then I literally have no idea
what happens.

429
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:47,590
Powers. Wait, but what about our date
tonight?

430
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:50,921
She might be our future wife.

431
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,160
There might not be a future if you don't
come with me right now.

432
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,050
Eight minutes. How are we going to get.

433
00:39:06,439 --> 00:39:07,529
What are you doing?

434
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,720
Will you stop whining?

435
00:39:08,811 --> 00:39:10,221
It's gonna feel kind of weird.

436
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:36,040
This. The walk through the door.

437
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,860
Yes, it's. It's okay.

438
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,760
It's called facing.

439
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,700
Come on. its facing.

440
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,050
Everybody moves.

441
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:18,140
Oh, this is it.

442
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,029
This is where I was sitting.

443
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,019
And actually, let.

444
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,460
Me take this for you.

445
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,149
Thank you.

446
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,910
Hey, just open those windows.

447
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:29,809
Clear out the fumes.

448
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,500
Right around now. I was sitting in that
chair.

449
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:35,901
I was right under this shelf of chemicals.

450
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:37,250
That's when the lightning hits.

451
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,340
Wait. I get hit by a lightning.

452
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,960
No, no, no. You don't get hit by lightning,
okay?

453
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:47,090
The lightning hits the chemicals, which then
you get bathed in, and that's what

454
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,890
electrocutes you. Okay, but I want to be
electrocuted.

455
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,990
Now you sit down.

456
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,401
I already have the power.

457
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,660
You already have the power.

458
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,180
Exactly. You're not getting struck by
lightning.

459
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:46,979
Looks like you are, too.

460
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,510
You have to do.

461
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:17,170
Up. Go check it.

462
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:28,150
Securing the entrance in the face.

463
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:10,380
Hey.

464
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,520
I'm slow.

465
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,360
Why is your place so much nicer than.

466
00:43:32,381 --> 00:43:33,941
Than I expected it to be?

467
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,340
Oh, you like it? Mom had to help decorate.

468
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:38,291
You know Mom, right?

469
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,939
Yeah. Classic mom.

470
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:41,409
Classic mom.

471
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:49,119
What a day.

472
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:55,329
Barry. The accident gave you powers but took
mine away, so I don't know how I get back

473
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:57,079
without access to the Speed Force.

474
00:43:57,129 --> 00:43:59,709
I don't know how I ever leave.

475
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:01,361
Do you understand what I'm saying?

476
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,460
I might be stuck.

477
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,060
Wait. I have powers now.

478
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:09,669
Yeah, but you do.

479
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,420
Speedballs. Okay.

480
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:29,508
I know this is incredibly exciting because I
went through it.

481
00:44:29,509 --> 00:44:30,589
Speedy Gonzales.

482
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,930
Yes, I've done it many times myself.

483
00:44:32,959 --> 00:44:34,059
You? Yes. Just.

484
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:19,591
What did you do?

485
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,580
Nothing. Why?

486
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,420
Barry could have told you about the clothes.

487
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:33,571
It's friction. You run too fast and regular
fabrics, you're going to burn up.

488
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,580
It's the same reason why you can't move
people very far at hyper speed.

489
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,980
That broccoli looks rotten.

490
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:44,429
Look, some things you can move like you can
move, for instance, a microwave, but you

491
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,240
can't move something like, say, a baby.

492
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:49,140
Barry, It's like I've never eaten anything
before.

493
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,230
Everything is just vivid flavor.

494
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,609
Try a little bit here.

495
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,190
A little bite. That's bad, isn't it?

496
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,110
This is not good. No, I was kidding.

497
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,350
I'm amazing. We.

498
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,020
We're amazing. So.

499
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,879
Hey, wait. I want to try that phasing thing.

500
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:07,921
How do I do that? You don't.

501
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,329
Not yet. Okay.

502
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,530
It's very complicated.

503
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,038
It takes a long time to train your body to
be able to speed up whilst your molecules

504
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,659
slow down enough to pass through the.

505
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,490
Molecular structure of solid objects.

506
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,160
You've got to start letting me finish my
sentences.

507
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:36,130
We always just sleepy and hungry and naked.

508
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:37,760
Well, the first two.

509
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:39,008
Yes, the third one.

510
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:40,770
No, I figured that part out.

511
00:47:40,779 --> 00:47:44,498
And honestly, if we're going to do this,
there's a lot I'm going to have to explain to

512
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,290
you. So a good place to start, I guess, is
that.

513
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:52,120
Yeah, the original soup was actually made
out of this polysynth.

514
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:55,541
Or will pick this up tomorrow.

515
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:58,239
So the suit is inside the ring?

516
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,860
Yeah. What?

517
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,160
And I can have this.

518
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,700
No, you can't have it.

519
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,280
You can borrow it. So you don't kill
yourself using your powers.

520
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:10,780
You're going to push this button and the
silk molecules are going to uncoil absorbing

521
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,200
atmospheric gases and expanding the suit to
full size.

522
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:13,929
Ready?

523
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,830
Oh, he was so.

524
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:33,341
Tiny.

525
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:34,959
You're supposed to put it on.

526
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:39,160
Before it hits the floor. What, like change
right here in front of you?

527
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,659
There's no one even here anyway.

528
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,540
Barry. Come on. Oh, man.

529
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:44,440
Tight.

530
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,630
It hurts.

531
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:48,191
You know where it hurts?

532
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:49,718
My dick. Okay.

533
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,510
I know, I know, but don't need to know.

534
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,980
Sorry. Can we move on?

535
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:59,200
Here's what I'm thinking. If I can train you
to move like I do, then we can recreate the

536
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,749
Chrono Ball. Chrono Ball in the Speed Force.

537
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:02,919
Speed Force.

538
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,959
And then maybe we can find some way to get
me back to the future.

539
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,000
Back to the future? Yes.

540
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:11,021
Eric Stoltz is your boy in that movie.

541
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:13,390
What an embodied performance.

542
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:14,740
You mean Michael J. Fox.

543
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:18,220
Back to the Future. Yeah, in the movie Back
to the Future.

544
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:23,410
What's going on?

545
00:49:31,171 --> 00:49:32,301
You need to take the suit off now.

546
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:42,370
Thank God. Object hovering above the
Australian

547
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:47,331
seaboard. We've obtained footage side by
side.

548
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,679
What's this?

549
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:57,460
Odd Satellite data has confirmed the presence
of a spacecraft.

550
00:49:57,491 --> 00:49:58,871
We'll be back.

551
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,450
My name is General Zod.

552
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,190
I come from a world far from yours.

553
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,520
For some time, your world has sheltered my
citizens.

554
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,350
I think. Have any?

555
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,089
In my custody.

556
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:22,071
What's happening?

557
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:25,399
The reasons I was looking for Superman.

558
00:50:25,761 --> 00:50:27,081
What's a superman?

559
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:33,331
Superman is an alien who lives on earth, I'm
assuming still incognito.

560
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:38,379
But yeah, he's an alien and he's very
powerful and he's just the best.

561
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,350
And then Zod is an alien from the same
planet.

562
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,469
Also very powerful, but he's just the worst.

563
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:47,080
And Zod came here to find Clark.

564
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:48,520
Wait. Who's Clark?

565
00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:50,109
Clark is Superman.

566
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,729
Oh, okay.

567
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:56,319
But then Zod also tried to terraform the
planet with this world engine thing, and

568
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,550
Superman stopped him eventually.

569
00:50:57,551 --> 00:50:59,951
But not before Zod killed thousands of
people.

570
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,820
At the time, there was nothing I could do.

571
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:09,829
I. Wait, you.

572
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:10,731
You were there.

573
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,419
I'd just gotten my powers.

574
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,480
I was still putting some finishing touches on
my suit.

575
00:51:23,351 --> 00:51:24,970
These things are World Engine.

576
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:26,769
It's started destroying Metropolis.

577
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:30,490
So I just. I just went there and I started
trying to save people.

578
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,430
Drag your way.

579
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,810
There's this kid.

580
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,950
I got him with. Can you get his dad?

581
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,890
That's all I could do to save that one kid.

582
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,910
Only Superman could stop Zod.

583
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:19,000
Not in time to save those people.

584
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,160
And now it's about to happen again.

585
00:52:21,821 --> 00:52:22,511
But.

586
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,150
If I can find the entire Justice League.

587
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,580
Superman and the rest of the band.

588
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,500
Right, then maybe I can prevent the whole
thing from ever even happening at all.

589
00:52:36,781 --> 00:52:38,431
Give me your laptop. Okay.

590
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:41,641
Does that smell? Could be anything.

591
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,480
Nicely. Who's that?

592
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,290
Oh, that's Gary.

593
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,360
That's the smell.

594
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,250
It's. Don't worry. He's busy.

595
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,190
We can do this.

596
00:52:53,511 --> 00:52:54,861
Uh, let's see. Victor Stone.

597
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,250
Gotham City University.

598
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,810
Oh, this is my roommate, Patty.

599
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,549
Patty is.

600
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,770
Your roommate. And that's her boyfriend,
Albert.

601
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:09,421
What's up? Good morning.

602
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,740
Oh, and, uh, guys, this is my cousin Barry.

603
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,000
I'm starving.

604
00:53:57,759 --> 00:53:59,528
Okay. Cactustown.

605
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:00,719
Gotham City University.

606
00:54:00,731 --> 00:54:02,161
Yes. Here he is.

607
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:04,390
Victor Stone, star quarterback for the
night.

608
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:05,770
Shit. Okay.

609
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:07,080
He's not cyborg yet.

610
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:09,520
Wonder Woman.

611
00:54:09,881 --> 00:54:16,421
Wonder Woman, Las Vegas residency,
illusions, juggling and zebras.

612
00:54:16,449 --> 00:54:18,819
No, that is not Diana.

613
00:54:18,941 --> 00:54:21,041
Aquaman. Aquaman star.

614
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,540
Like a super mermaid.

615
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:25,719
No, Albert, he's not a super mermaid, okay?

616
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:29,679
He's. He's half Atlantean, half human, with
superhuman strength who can control marine

617
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:31,421
life with his mind. So, like a super
mermaid?

618
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,890
No, Albert.

619
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,000
It's a described.

620
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:35,550
We'll just try.

621
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:38,229
Arthur Curry main.

622
00:54:39,731 --> 00:54:41,531
Lighthouse.

623
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:43,599
Here we are. Thomas Curry.

624
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,400
That's Dad. Phone.

625
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,240
Hello. Hello?

626
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:50,680
Thomas Curry? Yes.

627
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,270
Could I speak to Arthur?

628
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:53,649
Is Arthur around?

629
00:54:53,739 --> 00:54:54,969
You want to speak to my dog?

630
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:57,159
No, no.

631
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,300
I'm sorry.

632
00:54:58,779 --> 00:55:00,159
Is this Thomas Curry?

633
00:55:00,191 --> 00:55:03,011
Yes. And you work at a lighthouse?

634
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,530
Yes. Okay. And your wife is the queen of
Atlantis?

635
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:10,839
Yes. Uh, no.

636
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:18,609
Uh, right. But maybe. Maybe a fishlike woman
washed into your life at some point or

637
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:19,629
another. Very funny.

638
00:55:19,629 --> 00:55:24,189
I saw Arthur Curry was never born.

639
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,529
What? This is a disaster.

640
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,660
I completely destroyed history.

641
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:30,069
Well, it's still okay.

642
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,780
Why do you keep saying Eric Stoltz.

643
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,070
Eric Stoltz. Marty McFly.

644
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:33,820
What?

645
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:36,250
Time travel. Oh, are you talking to.

646
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:37,840
Come on. Who is this guy?

647
00:55:37,871 --> 00:55:39,830
Okay. Yeah. No, I know.

648
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:41,478
I've seen all of them.

649
00:55:41,479 --> 00:55:43,879
And Eric Stoltz is not Marty McFly.

650
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:44,660
Really?

651
00:55:46,819 --> 00:55:48,439
Thanks. Spleen. Marty McFly here.

652
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,019
I can't explain that to you, Gary.

653
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:51,320
That's not your thigh.

654
00:55:51,709 --> 00:55:53,028
It's the wrong actor.

655
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,300
And it's upside down, is it?

656
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:05,269
The point is that in Back to the Future,
Marty McFly is very famously played by

657
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:06,588
Michael J. Fox, the.

658
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,460
Guy from Footloose.

659
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:09,110
No, that's Kevin Bacon.

660
00:56:09,139 --> 00:56:11,089
Bacon. Kevin Bacon's maverick with the
volleyball.

661
00:56:11,661 --> 00:56:12,831
The gay guys in the planes.

662
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,780
Top Gun. Great Balls of fire.

663
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:15,170
Top Gun.

664
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:18,080
No, no, no, no. Right. Completely broke the
universe.

665
00:56:21,261 --> 00:56:23,291
Marty McFly is Eric Stoltz.

666
00:56:23,301 --> 00:56:24,861
Yes. Thank you.

667
00:56:25,461 --> 00:56:27,321
Created a world with no mad humans.

668
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,641
And now there's no one to defend us from Zod.

669
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:31,189
Albert.

670
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:34,050
There's a cyborg.

671
00:56:35,161 --> 00:56:37,050
There's no Aquaman, there's no Wonder Woman.

672
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,760
There's no Superman.

673
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:40,210
There's no Batman.

674
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,070
I'm Batman. You.

675
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:44,429
What?

676
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:46,050
What? What did you just say?

677
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:47,790
I'm,

678
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,660
That man exists on Dopey.

679
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:57,090
Yeah. Dude, nobody knows who he really is,
but he exists, right?

680
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,249
Well, we.

681
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:04,620
My cousin Barry and I have to go to that
cousins dinner now.

682
00:57:05,309 --> 00:57:09,029
But it was a pleasure to meet you all.

683
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:10,321
And Gary.

684
00:57:10,350 --> 00:57:12,539
Barry. Barry.

685
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,860
Gary. Barry.

686
00:57:33,471 --> 00:57:35,140
What, are you freaking kidding.

687
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,430
Me with this place?

688
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:41,260
What is this? Hell.

689
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,529
Oh, look at all.

690
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,190
This cool shit.

691
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,040
Don't touch anything in here.

692
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,140
Hello. Bruce

693
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,670
Bruce, are you there?

694
00:58:20,290 --> 00:58:24,890
Good buddy

695
00:58:25,011 --> 00:58:26,621
Hey, I didn't know you painted.

696
00:58:27,279 --> 00:58:28,299
They're good.

697
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,320
Bruce Wayne.

698
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,050
Bruce.

699
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:59,386
Hey, check this out. There's, like, bells
connected to every room in this house.

700
00:58:59,461 --> 00:59:02,641
Hey, maybe we could find this Bruce guy if
we just ring all these bells, right?

701
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,107
You don't understand how servant bells work.

702
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:09,058
Those are all the bells. You ring them from
all the other places you don't have, like

703
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:10,699
Downton Abbey in your universe.

704
00:59:10,735 --> 00:59:12,005
Downton Abbey.

705
00:59:12,325 --> 00:59:13,735
The chain of, like, family style
restaurants.

706
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:16,674
Like, it's like, cheaper banana bees.

707
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:18,347
Oh, not really.

708
00:59:18,381 --> 00:59:19,581
Go for right now.

709
00:59:19,611 --> 00:59:21,981
Abbey Sizzlin Sand key Square.

710
00:59:51,364 --> 00:59:53,394
No, man. I've had it with you.

711
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:30,183
How are you?

712
01:00:31,201 --> 01:00:32,491
The guy who lives here?

713
01:00:33,779 --> 01:00:39,509
We're looking for Bruce Wayne Younger.

714
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:40,937
Following the broadcast.

715
01:00:42,216 --> 01:00:43,826
The individual they're searching for.

716
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,205
So.

717
01:00:50,092 --> 01:00:51,732
You're the same person as him.

718
01:00:51,771 --> 01:00:53,559
But from an alternate timeline.

719
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,610
Yes. In which.

720
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:58,639
You and I are friends.

721
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:01,247
Yeah. You're, like, probably my best friend.

722
01:01:02,005 --> 01:01:03,783
Yeah, well, but you're a bit.

723
01:01:03,824 --> 01:01:07,489
You're, uh, chronologically different.

724
01:01:07,572 --> 01:01:10,002
Older. And that's what I can't understand.

725
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:13,469
I traveled back in time from here to here.

726
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:16,959
Yet somehow everything's all changed back
here.

727
01:01:17,836 --> 01:01:19,146
Or like, when you were born, so.

728
01:01:19,835 --> 01:01:23,165
Well, time is linear, right?

729
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:28,649
Right. At some point we.

730
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:34,742
Probably saw a movie that told you if you
went back and changed the past, you create a

731
01:01:34,877 --> 01:01:36,811
kind of a branched timeline.

732
01:01:36,856 --> 01:01:43,886
Right? New present.

733
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:45,872
New future.

734
01:01:45,911 --> 01:01:48,451
Yeah, well, time doesn't work like that.

735
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:49,894
That's not how time works.

736
01:01:49,919 --> 01:01:53,609
When you go back and change the past, you
create a fulcrum.

737
01:01:53,936 --> 01:01:56,276
You put yourself on a whole nother strand of
spaghetti.

738
01:01:58,393 --> 01:02:00,703
The future. New path.

739
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:03,312
It's retrocausal.

740
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:04,961
It goes both ways.

741
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:06,670
Actually, it goes many ways.

742
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,380
Maybe some other time.

743
01:02:09,368 --> 01:02:11,978
Okay. But in an ontological paradox model,
there's not.

744
01:02:13,026 --> 01:02:17,076
What you did was you changed the future and
you changed the past.

745
01:02:17,883 --> 01:02:25,053
If a person is stupid enough to mess with
time, but you eventually end up with this

746
01:02:27,268 --> 01:02:31,288
multiverse, some strands run almost
parallel.

747
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:38,306
There will be inevitable intersections and
others that are just wildly divergent.

748
01:02:39,252 --> 01:02:44,712
Unless it's a hot mess, it's a crapshoot.

749
01:02:45,638 --> 01:02:46,898
It's all just a crapshoot.

750
01:02:47,227 --> 01:02:49,161
Is the premise on meat metaphors over?

751
01:02:49,205 --> 01:02:51,155
Just a garnish. I'll tell you something.

752
01:02:52,404 --> 01:02:59,284
Person would have to be an idiot to play
craps with space time continuum.

753
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:00,780
Idiot.

754
01:03:03,068 --> 01:03:07,338
Here. Okay.

755
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:09,756
Are you joking with the chewing noises right
now?

756
01:03:10,175 --> 01:03:16,925
So you're the reason the Zod character is
about to destroy the earth?

757
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,630
Maybe there's a guy called Superman who can
stop Zod.

758
01:03:21,728 --> 01:03:23,788
Yeah. Yeah. And flies.

759
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:25,696
Shoots lasers out of his eyes.

760
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:26,585
Yes, He flies and he.

761
01:03:26,605 --> 01:03:27,595
Shoots lasers out of his eyes.

762
01:03:28,194 --> 01:03:29,724
No one said Superman.

763
01:03:31,013 --> 01:03:32,693
That might be a little on the nose.

764
01:03:33,502 --> 01:03:34,762
You call yourself Batman?

765
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:35,331
Yeah.

766
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,580
I don't call myself super Batman.

767
01:03:37,699 --> 01:03:39,634
Oh, wait.

768
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:43,668
He's Batman. What did you think we were
doing here?

769
01:03:43,815 --> 01:03:46,014
Thought this was the cousins dinner.

770
01:03:46,065 --> 01:03:47,588
He's Bruce Wayne.

771
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:48,343
Is Batman.

772
01:03:48,803 --> 01:03:50,413
Really? Not so much anymore.

773
01:03:51,162 --> 01:03:53,502
You know, really need me?

774
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,750
Things have changed.

775
01:03:56,779 --> 01:03:59,629
Gotham is now one of the safest cities in
the world.

776
01:04:00,287 --> 01:04:01,430
I need you.

777
01:04:01,457 --> 01:04:03,391
We need you in my timeline.

778
01:04:03,435 --> 01:04:04,695
Batman's our strategist.

779
01:04:04,725 --> 01:04:05,745
Our leader.

780
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:07,093
The world needs Superman.

781
01:04:07,122 --> 01:04:08,412
You're the best detective in the world.

782
01:04:08,443 --> 01:04:10,403
You're probably the only person who can help
me find him.

783
01:04:10,451 --> 01:04:12,161
So will you help us?

784
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:19,654
Pass that way.

785
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:21,256
Pass the salt.

786
01:04:22,094 --> 01:04:26,384
Gross. You just want to help us.

787
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:29,472
We're going to use this batshit batshit.

788
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,180
Yeah, it's bad stuff.

789
01:04:32,329 --> 01:04:32,768
It's bad.

790
01:04:32,779 --> 01:04:34,489
Things. Stand on that thing.

791
01:04:37,806 --> 01:04:39,276
Okay. Remember when you phase through the
floor?

792
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,575
Yeah. So I need you to do that again.

793
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:51,930
What is this place?

794
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,460
Spray. Street thieves.

795
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:06,238
Thieves.

796
01:06:17,821 --> 01:06:22,249
Barry almost died in an abyss.

797
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:25,838
12,805 accounts in the US.

798
01:06:25,917 --> 01:06:26,444
Is this what.

799
01:06:26,457 --> 01:06:27,717
I think it is?

800
01:06:37,651 --> 01:06:39,101
Oh, shit.

801
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,689
I used to see this thing on the news when I
was a kid.

802
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:44,396
Fine.

803
01:06:46,935 --> 01:06:48,781
Earth was born.

804
01:06:48,824 --> 01:06:50,024
He arrived.

805
01:06:50,324 --> 01:06:51,344
Oh, Barry.

806
01:06:51,372 --> 01:06:53,202
Look, I'm busy.

807
01:06:53,352 --> 01:06:58,482
With what? Looking for unidentified objects
entering Earth's atmosphere anywhere near

808
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,534
Kansas in the last 50 years.

809
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:02,349
He has a back door into NASA.

810
01:07:03,127 --> 01:07:06,097
Of course he does. Yeah, but, Barry.

811
01:07:06,665 --> 01:07:09,695
Check this out. This bag laughs.

812
01:07:11,103 --> 01:07:13,293
Hey, can't you take anything seriously?

813
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:14,851
Stop messing around.

814
01:07:15,091 --> 01:07:16,441
Dude, come on.

815
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:18,526
Have you seen this place?

816
01:07:18,568 --> 01:07:20,414
It's amazing.

817
01:07:20,456 --> 01:07:24,414
Hello. How's the gravity of this not sunk in
for you?

818
01:07:24,505 --> 01:07:26,000
Stop messing around, Barry.

819
01:07:26,034 --> 01:07:27,234
I won't say it again.

820
01:07:27,983 --> 01:07:30,358
Yeesh. Sorry, Mom.

821
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,093
Shut up. Shut up!

822
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:34,370
You have no idea how lucky you are.

823
01:07:34,519 --> 01:07:35,599
No idea.

824
01:07:35,629 --> 01:07:37,182
You take everything for granted.

825
01:07:37,218 --> 01:07:38,598
You don't even appreciate.

826
01:07:39,047 --> 01:07:42,917
You just walk around thinking you're so
funny and so cool.

827
01:07:43,275 --> 01:07:48,093
And it's embarrassing because you're not any
of those things is you.

828
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:49,792
Screw you, man.

829
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,770
I've done nothing but everything you've
asked.

830
01:07:52,399 --> 01:07:54,229
You made me get struck by lightning.

831
01:07:54,558 --> 01:07:55,728
Face naked through the floor.

832
01:07:55,878 --> 01:07:58,868
Terrified. Mr. Johansen, Now I'm probably
going to have to move.

833
01:07:58,936 --> 01:08:01,126
You won't even tell me why you're here.

834
01:08:01,425 --> 01:08:05,353
But will you at least tell me why you're
being so mean to me for no reason?

835
01:08:05,442 --> 01:08:07,602
You use monkey as a dartboard.

836
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,880
Wait. What?

837
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:14,767
We get it? The monkey.

838
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:18,082
Quick. So you're mad at me for playing.

839
01:08:18,155 --> 01:08:19,235
With a toy?

840
01:08:19,265 --> 01:08:20,525
It's not a toy.

841
01:08:21,124 --> 01:08:24,671
Mom bought us that monkey because she calls
us monkeys.

842
01:08:24,751 --> 01:08:27,541
She gives us monkey stuff all the time.

843
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:33,190
Right? Look, I'm sorry.

844
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:37,155
I'm not very good with people.

845
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:41,624
Even myself. Oh, come on, dude.

846
01:08:41,722 --> 01:08:43,392
You're not that bad.

847
01:08:44,001 --> 01:08:46,001
You just be kind of a dick sometimes, but.

848
01:08:48,179 --> 01:08:50,159
Let's face it, I am pretty obnoxious.

849
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:51,837
I just get excited.

850
01:08:52,347 --> 01:08:55,197
Come on. This place is pretty cool, right?

851
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:59,841
Yeah. All right.

852
01:08:59,932 --> 01:09:00,862
Well, um.

853
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:03,621
I'll let you work.

854
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,598
Know you're there. You'd.

855
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,488
I'm stuck on that thing you said with the
spaghetti.

856
01:09:32,295 --> 01:09:35,535
You said there were certain intersections
that would always be inevitable.

857
01:09:37,422 --> 01:09:38,562
You had an Alfred.

858
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:40,390
My Bruce has an Alfred.

859
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,981
Different worlds, different times.

860
01:09:43,028 --> 01:09:44,978
Yet there it is.

861
01:09:45,188 --> 01:09:50,588
Certain people, certain events, certain
strands of spaghetti.

862
01:09:51,094 --> 01:09:52,237
Drawn to each other.

863
01:09:52,264 --> 01:09:53,884
Like. Like magnets.

864
01:09:54,962 --> 01:10:01,982
I've read all about temporal paradoxes and
causal loops, but this is more than that.

865
01:10:02,837 --> 01:10:06,004
Inevitable intersections are something none
of the theories could have anticipated

866
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:08,596
because. Well, how do you explain that?

867
01:10:08,654 --> 01:10:09,374
Except for.

868
01:10:11,014 --> 01:10:13,734
Hey. If you are listening.

869
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:15,891
Sorry about your parents.

870
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,250
Just trying to save mine. To be away.

871
01:10:23,256 --> 01:10:24,846
Away. Barry, Just keep trying.

872
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:17,120
Barry, wake up. Clark's being held by a
mercenary group in a Siberian black site.

873
01:11:17,537 --> 01:11:18,557
Get up, Barry.

874
01:11:18,616 --> 01:11:19,626
Let me go, Sunfire.

875
01:11:20,865 --> 01:11:24,585
We're going to Russia. Wait.

876
01:11:26,193 --> 01:11:27,743
Oh, Coffee.

877
01:11:29,570 --> 01:11:30,620
How are we going to get to Russia?

878
01:12:08,359 --> 01:12:09,709
I hope you get this, Superman.

879
01:12:10,638 --> 01:12:12,948
Then you're on your own.

880
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:29,592
You are here. I'm Batman.

881
01:13:16,342 --> 01:13:18,442
Yeah. So what's the plan?

882
01:13:18,830 --> 01:13:20,480
We're just going to one grab Superman and
Dipset.

883
01:13:20,869 --> 01:13:22,069
For the block is hot.

884
01:13:22,338 --> 01:13:24,528
Don't know. You should ask him.

885
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:27,806
You asking? You should ask him.

886
01:13:27,885 --> 01:13:29,409
Yeah. I'm not gonna ask him.

887
01:13:29,445 --> 01:13:29,875
Why not?

888
01:13:29,954 --> 01:13:31,800
I thought that was supposed to be your
friend. Not this one.

889
01:13:31,843 --> 01:13:32,623
Not this. Batman.

890
01:13:32,892 --> 01:13:35,172
We're here activating hover mode.

891
01:13:40,587 --> 01:13:41,577
Ejector seat.

892
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:49,081
Ejector seat. Okay.

893
01:13:49,243 --> 01:13:50,023
There are stages.

894
01:13:52,031 --> 01:13:53,891
You're strapped to your parachutes.

895
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,520
It was yours.

896
01:14:08,263 --> 01:14:10,393
Oh, this is Rimstead.

897
01:14:30,192 --> 01:14:31,512
All clear. Let's move.

898
01:14:58,286 --> 01:14:59,336
Everybody's proud. No.

899
01:15:00,655 --> 01:15:02,605
It's so cold. The Arctic Fairy.

900
01:15:05,632 --> 01:15:08,122
Where do you go? Just follow the footprints.

901
01:15:13,487 --> 01:15:15,047
Superman would be down there for sure.

902
01:15:54,325 --> 01:15:58,905
Chasing is. Okay.

903
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:28,036
What did she do?

904
01:16:28,076 --> 01:16:29,825
I had to move you, but I just did it.

905
01:16:29,865 --> 01:16:30,435
A little.

906
01:16:32,354 --> 01:16:32,724
Feisty.

907
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:40,400
This might hurt.

908
01:17:12,042 --> 01:17:13,042
Push for more.

909
01:17:26,673 --> 01:17:27,883
Lets go.

910
01:17:36,269 --> 01:17:37,379
That's where you keep Superman.

911
01:17:38,638 --> 01:17:39,198
Big scrotum.

912
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:53,760
He's going to hack the Soviet security cyber
scrotum.

913
01:17:54,149 --> 01:17:54,989
With a fuck phone.

914
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:01,366
I tried all the combinations.

915
01:18:04,533 --> 01:18:04,923
Yes.

916
01:18:49,918 --> 01:18:54,428
Come. It's not him.

917
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,424
It's got to go. Wait.

918
01:18:57,964 --> 01:18:58,959
I can't just leave her here.

919
01:18:58,982 --> 01:19:02,482
What? wake her? I'll just go.

920
01:19:11,187 --> 01:19:11,607
I got you.

921
01:19:30,927 --> 01:19:32,367
I'll handle this, Jabroni.

922
01:19:37,543 --> 01:19:39,163
What up?

923
01:20:41,027 --> 01:20:41,867
Hurry up.

924
01:21:01,637 --> 01:21:05,477
No. Come on, let's go.

925
01:21:08,012 --> 01:21:09,448
You didn't tell me We can get shot.

926
01:21:09,482 --> 01:21:10,952
Why would you assume we couldn't?

927
01:21:22,534 --> 01:21:25,534
Oh, great. The guy at the feet of a Sputnik.

928
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:32,840
Oh, man, I need this knee.

929
01:21:33,399 --> 01:21:34,529
Oh, it'll heal. Come on.

930
01:21:47,831 --> 01:21:48,491
How much do you weigh?

931
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:50,046
180 each, plus her.

932
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,710
440.

933
01:21:55,158 --> 01:21:58,338
Hold on.

934
01:22:32,386 --> 01:22:32,666
Hi.

935
01:22:36,354 --> 01:22:39,224
Mary. Shut up. What's the play.

936
01:22:39,582 --> 01:22:40,812
Batman? What do we do? What now?

937
01:22:47,419 --> 01:22:48,709
We try not to die.

938
01:23:48,644 --> 01:23:50,914
Uh, you guys just see that in slow mo.

939
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:30,253
Yeah, I'm just realizing that I didn't really
think this through.

940
01:24:31,482 --> 01:24:33,462
There are good kryptonians and then there
are.

941
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,500
Very, very bad kryptonians.

942
01:24:35,628 --> 01:24:40,163
It was very confident that they were just
going to find man and we found Superman that

943
01:24:40,266 --> 01:24:42,082
this would all be super simple.

944
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:43,744
Who are you?

945
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:48,513
Hi, I'm Barry.

946
01:24:49,441 --> 01:24:53,839
We were trying to find Carol, but we found
you instead.

947
01:24:53,938 --> 01:24:56,308
What do you want with Carol? We were trying
to.

948
01:24:56,427 --> 01:24:57,147
Trying to rescue him.

949
01:24:57,177 --> 01:24:57,717
Why?

950
01:24:58,706 --> 01:25:00,926
Because he's my friend.

951
01:25:01,464 --> 01:25:02,934
Do you? Do you know him?

952
01:25:03,173 --> 01:25:04,753
She looks mad already.

953
01:25:05,002 --> 01:25:06,232
She might do laser vision.

954
01:25:06,262 --> 01:25:07,845
Or she might do, like, a freezing breath.

955
01:25:07,881 --> 01:25:08,881
Or you would just start.

956
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:12,080
My name is Kara, daughter of Zorro.

957
01:25:13,368 --> 01:25:13,925
Kal-el is.

958
01:25:13,938 --> 01:25:15,948
My cousin. Who's Kal-El?

959
01:25:16,056 --> 01:25:17,355
Again? It's Superman.

960
01:25:17,385 --> 01:25:19,026
No, because you said that was Clark.

961
01:25:19,065 --> 01:25:19,815
Who's Clark?

962
01:25:20,114 --> 01:25:22,214
Clark is his human name.

963
01:25:23,322 --> 01:25:24,162
Clark.

964
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:29,110
He was an infant when we left.

965
01:25:30,818 --> 01:25:32,178
The last son of Krypton, I.

966
01:25:34,116 --> 01:25:35,736
I was sent to protect him.

967
01:25:36,335 --> 01:25:38,255
Looks like he never made it to earth in this
universe.

968
01:25:39,933 --> 01:25:42,093
Our paths. They must have separated.

969
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,121
Wait, so you thought.

970
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,790
A baby was going to protect us from this Zod
guy?

971
01:25:46,589 --> 01:25:47,939
General Zod is here.

972
01:25:48,358 --> 01:25:49,678
He must have tracked my pod signal.

973
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:51,147
I have to go.

974
01:25:51,176 --> 01:25:53,111
Whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.

975
01:25:53,156 --> 01:25:54,446
You need to recover your strength.

976
01:25:55,195 --> 01:25:56,836
Barry. Take her to the.

977
01:25:56,874 --> 01:25:59,244
Roof and put her in the sun.

978
01:25:59,812 --> 01:26:01,688
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

979
01:26:01,731 --> 01:26:04,521
Like, I mean, now you're solar powered.

980
01:26:04,759 --> 01:26:05,960
Good for you. I've been trying.

981
01:26:05,989 --> 01:26:07,309
To. Oh.

982
01:26:08,948 --> 01:26:10,688
We'll take that with us.

983
01:26:21,291 --> 01:26:23,901
Michael to turn around.

984
01:26:24,948 --> 01:26:26,298
Are you dressed?

985
01:26:26,978 --> 01:26:28,398
Red cape.

986
01:26:35,182 --> 01:26:36,922
You're levitating.

987
01:26:44,757 --> 01:26:46,017
It's always this loud.

988
01:26:49,015 --> 01:26:50,275
Is it loud?

989
01:26:50,964 --> 01:26:52,144
Are you good?

990
01:26:52,193 --> 01:26:55,433
Do you feel you feel strong yet or.

991
01:27:01,389 --> 01:27:02,139
Yeah, that seems.

992
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:09,426
It seems strong. You know, old man Barry down
there says if we don't stop Captain Zod,

993
01:27:09,574 --> 01:27:11,974
he'll kill thousands of people.

994
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:13,233
Billions of people.

995
01:27:13,502 --> 01:27:14,312
Billions.

996
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:18,224
Of your people. They're good people.

997
01:27:18,269 --> 01:27:19,019
Good people.

998
01:27:20,517 --> 01:27:25,857
We came to this planet looking for a safe
place to live, and they put me in a cage.

999
01:27:26,306 --> 01:27:26,756
Yeah.

1000
01:27:27,204 --> 01:27:28,845
A lot of humans are dicks.

1001
01:27:28,883 --> 01:27:30,573
But then there's.

1002
01:27:30,992 --> 01:27:32,082
There's babies.

1003
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:58,803
If I can recreate the accident that gave me
my powers, maybe I can get back to the Speed

1004
01:27:58,898 --> 01:28:00,858
Force and maybe even stand a chance against
Thor.

1005
01:28:02,345 --> 01:28:04,475
Or kill yourself in the process.

1006
01:28:07,862 --> 01:28:12,062
Tell me something. You get your powers back.

1007
01:28:12,449 --> 01:28:13,589
You can go anywhere.

1008
01:28:13,859 --> 01:28:16,469
You got another timeline, Another universe.

1009
01:28:17,007 --> 01:28:20,427
Why do you want to stay and fight to save
this one?

1010
01:28:21,523 --> 01:28:23,593
Because this is the one where my mom lives.

1011
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:28,731
I went back in time to save her.

1012
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:31,220
I'm not going to lose her again.

1013
01:28:31,999 --> 01:28:33,019
Kid doesn't know, does he?

1014
01:28:33,858 --> 01:28:35,538
Do you tell someone something like that?

1015
01:28:40,164 --> 01:28:41,454
I left my parents.

1016
01:28:45,221 --> 01:28:51,451
That pain. Made me who I am.

1017
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:53,040
Not sure I know who I am.

1018
01:28:53,067 --> 01:28:54,177
Without it, actually.

1019
01:28:58,804 --> 01:29:04,444
I spent a lifetime trying  right forms of path

1020
01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:11,340
As if putting on a cape and fighting crime
would bring my parents back.

1021
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:19,180
You actually did.

1022
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:27,366
So I guess the plan is to douse yourself in
industrial chemicals while electrocuting

1023
01:29:27,410 --> 01:29:28,100
yourself?

1024
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:34,050
Yeah. To know.

1025
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:38,780
Yeah, that would be incredibly useful.

1026
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:43,230
I've actually already borrowed this box.

1027
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,730
Libra be advised.

1028
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:33,120
You bring me nothing.

1029
01:30:35,849 --> 01:30:37,049
I gave you a warning.

1030
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:39,412
You're up there to.

1031
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:41,940
Deliver the Kryptonian traders being taken as
an.

1032
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:42,960
Act of war.

1033
01:31:21,490 --> 01:31:22,060
Okay.

1034
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:26,710
When throw the switch, the current should run
up the wire and draw the lightning right to

1035
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:28,720
the cave. Here, put that on.

1036
01:31:28,931 --> 01:31:31,061
Its heat and impact resistant should
protect.

1037
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:34,360
You a little. Right. But the point is for me
to not be protected.

1038
01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:36,640
Okay.

1039
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,010
You're going to need to be out of the way.

1040
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:47,290
Let's get you.

1041
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:54,920
It's just not gonna work, right?

1042
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:58,350
Of course it's gonna work. Nothing we
haven't done before.

1043
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,240
Besides, this time we have Batman.

1044
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:01,230
What could go wrong?

1045
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,200
For the record, I think this is insane.

1046
01:32:06,150 --> 01:32:13,180
Get back! It's fine.

1047
01:32:13,481 --> 01:32:13,801
It's fine.

1048
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:25,440
Reuven Seidman.

1049
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:33,260
Good.

1050
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:58,400
No, no, wait.

1051
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:06,880
Stop, Stop. Okay,

1052
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:09,650
Mary.

1053
01:33:13,969 --> 01:33:16,639
Go again. But.

1054
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:27,840
Circus ride.

1055
01:34:26,491 --> 01:34:27,061
We've got you.

1056
01:35:02,970 --> 01:35:04,370
You kids like pastime, right?

1057
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:06,130
You gotta heal now.

1058
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,460
Working.

1059
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:29,410
Yea. Yea. Yea.

1060
01:35:29,561 --> 01:35:30,141
Yea. Yea.

1061
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:32,100
Yea. Yea.

1062
01:35:32,110 --> 01:35:34,760
Yea. Scares the shit out of me.

1063
01:36:17,590 --> 01:36:19,420
Are you awake?

1064
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:21,160
How are you feeling?

1065
01:36:22,451 --> 01:36:25,361
So maybe this will help.

1066
01:36:38,620 --> 01:36:40,700
Yeah, Dude, come on.

1067
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,490
Irresistible, man.

1068
01:36:42,670 --> 01:36:43,780
It feels good to be back.

1069
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:46,780
Yeah. And what are we wearing tonight?

1070
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:49,939
You like it? I made it myself out of that
old bat suit.

1071
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,520
But, you know, I made it our colors and
everything.

1072
01:36:52,270 --> 01:36:56,470
Well, check this out. It's a bit more loose.

1073
01:36:58,830 --> 01:36:59,190
The piece.

1074
01:37:00,990 --> 01:37:04,530
Do you mean that mean don't.

1075
01:37:05,251 --> 01:37:08,916
Don't know what what it means exactly to be.

1076
01:37:08,940 --> 01:37:11,190
But it seems like it's positive.

1077
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:16,440
What are you doing? Came back.

1078
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:18,060
I'm glad you're okay.

1079
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:20,670
I have to ask you something.

1080
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:26,970
When you found me in that hole that they put
me in and I wasn't allow.

1081
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:31,250
Why did you help me?

1082
01:37:31,850 --> 01:37:32,870
Because you needed help.

1083
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:37,890
Do you know what the symbol stands for?

1084
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,130
Supergirl means hope, right?

1085
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:42,480
Oh, yeah. Does it mean hope?

1086
01:37:43,559 --> 01:37:46,049
Krypton was a beautiful place.

1087
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:49,710
We are a people of hope.

1088
01:37:50,729 --> 01:37:58,259
Not more

1089
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:01,200
Zod from krypton But he is not my people.

1090
01:38:01,860 --> 01:38:04,920
So you're saying Yes.

1091
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:07,170
I will help you fight Zod.

1092
01:38:12,340 --> 01:38:13,510
Interesting group.

1093
01:38:14,259 --> 01:38:15,519
What did you say?

1094
01:38:17,021 --> 01:38:18,161
They were called again?

1095
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:19,900
We're the Justice League.

1096
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:21,800
No, No.

1097
01:38:21,821 --> 01:38:24,221
Well, I mean, kind of.

1098
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:31,330
We are short one literal goddess, one
friendly terminator and super mermaid.

1099
01:38:32,230 --> 01:38:34,450
We could definitely use a Batman.

1100
01:38:37,770 --> 01:38:38,160
You are in

1101
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,010
You want to get nuts?

1102
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:48,460
Let's get nuts.

1103
01:39:02,349 --> 01:39:02,829
My world.

1104
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,945
Superman showed up right away when God called
him out.

1105
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,360
So as of now, we're in uncharted territory.

1106
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:11,830
What I do know is that Zod somehow controls
the world engines, which will be destroying

1107
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:13,379
much more than just Metropolis.

1108
01:39:13,390 --> 01:39:15,803
Now, with every passing second that we don't
stop in.

1109
01:39:15,819 --> 01:39:17,029
Barry. What are you doing?

1110
01:39:17,050 --> 01:39:20,830
Right. Our kids are going to see this.

1111
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:21,940
Your kids?

1112
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:25,519
Well, you know, like everybody's kids.

1113
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:28,400
I mean, the children of the world, they're
going to want to see this.

1114
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:32,231
We're getting close.

1115
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,850
I'm going to stay airborne and take out
their sky power.

1116
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:37,800
And Barry, just so we're clear, what that
essentially equates to is you and me versus

1117
01:39:37,819 --> 01:39:39,229
the entire Kryptonian army.

1118
01:39:39,659 --> 01:39:41,288
Chill. We need to buy Kyra.

1119
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,530
Enough time to take out Zod.

1120
01:39:43,340 --> 01:39:46,617
Oh, and remember that your suit doesn't
dissipate energy like mine, so you need to

1121
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:48,979
take breaks. Otherwise you're going to build
up too much charge.

1122
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:49,850
Wait, what?

1123
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:19,610
Humans we came to protect.

1124
01:40:19,641 --> 01:40:21,171
They don't know we're on their side.

1125
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:56,930
God.

1126
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:07,060
Guys.

1127
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:09,540
We've been waiting for you.

1128
01:41:39,441 --> 01:41:41,871
Okay. And the space giant.

1129
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:43,760
And this is just murder.

1130
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,042
Our responsibility.

1131
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:46,640
To. Hey, hey, hey. Don't think about that,
okay?

1132
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,591
Calm down. We're just gonna start with those
guys over there and, yeah, they're

1133
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:53,000
Kryptonian, and we won't be able to kill
them, but we can slow them down for her.

1134
01:41:53,091 --> 01:41:56,100
One at a time. Okay?

1135
01:41:56,119 --> 01:41:57,679
I'm going to disarm them, and then you'll
engage.

1136
01:42:00,590 --> 01:42:03,980
Punch. Come on, Barbie.

1137
01:42:04,970 --> 01:42:06,050
Let's go party.

1138
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:23,870
Oh, okay.

1139
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,570
It's okay. You're okay. Come on.

1140
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:27,560
Jesus. They're fast.

1141
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:29,440
Yes, but not as fast as us.

1142
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:34,231
Terraforming has.

1143
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:38,650
Begun. This world must die so that ours may
live again.

1144
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,860
On. It is gone.

1145
01:42:52,951 --> 01:42:55,801
Zod, your uncle Jor-El.

1146
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:03,540
Hid the key to Krypton's reverse inside a
Kryptonian child.

1147
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:11,590
All the genetic material needed to start
again, coded inside the DNA and sent to Earth

1148
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:12,900
in an escape pod.

1149
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,090
He's not here. You have failed.

1150
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,150
We found him.

1151
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,810
We intercepted his pod.

1152
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,551
But your cousin was.

1153
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,000
Not the one we needed.

1154
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:29,240
You are the one.

1155
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:34,820
It is your blood we must harvest.

1156
01:43:34,849 --> 01:43:35,829
What did you do to help.

1157
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:37,511
Your sacrifice.

1158
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:41,000
That will allow Krypton to live again?

1159
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:42,670
Whatdid you do?

1160
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:48,770
The infant did not survive.

1161
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,502
Look a new plan.

1162
01:44:23,511 --> 01:44:25,059
I'm going to create a cyclonic diversion.

1163
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:27,980
And you're going to just come in hard feet
first this time.

1164
01:44:38,681 --> 01:44:45,931
Yes, Barry.

1165
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:47,320
You see that here for.

1166
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:48,890
Your accumulating too much charge.

1167
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:52,370
What am I for this guy?

1168
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:25,122
Barry was actually only half stupid.

1169
01:45:25,140 --> 01:45:28,830
But if you're going to do that and not die,
you need to complete the circuit somehow.

1170
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:30,510
Try putting your hands together like.

1171
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:31,470
Like this.

1172
01:45:34,260 --> 01:45:37,860
Oh, shit. You're ready.

1173
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:57,921
I'm going after the big ones.

1174
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:13,950
You copy?

1175
01:47:14,999 --> 01:47:16,709
Where's Kyra? You go find her.

1176
01:47:25,130 --> 01:47:26,610
Failure detection.

1177
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:27,800
Failure.

1178
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:08,660
Rest Kerswill.

1179
01:48:14,699 --> 01:48:22,079
Going down. Go it alone.

1180
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:27,570
You go first. Eject, but just eject.

1181
01:48:35,159 --> 01:48:35,549
No.

1182
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:56,330
Cal. Soon

1183
01:48:59,330 --> 01:49:07,670
as it was having. Cal is dead.

1184
01:49:08,570 --> 01:49:08,980
He was dead.

1185
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:15,314
But they don't have to be right, because we
can go back like you did.

1186
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,670
You're not fast enough yet.

1187
01:49:16,700 --> 01:49:21,010
Are you sure? Barry?

1188
01:49:22,950 --> 01:49:23,540
Barry, wait.

1189
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:38,550
This is backing up?

1190
01:49:39,450 --> 01:49:48,160
Yeah, I guess so. It's bary

1191
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:52,256
But it's okay.

1192
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:53,681
We can fix this.

1193
01:49:54,491 --> 01:49:55,501
You know what? You're going to change.

1194
01:49:55,510 --> 01:49:56,830
I know what I'm going to change.

1195
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:03,200
Going after the big one.

1196
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:08,110
Oh, off that gunship is shield protected.

1197
01:50:08,380 --> 01:50:16,029
Roger that. But he's not

1198
01:50:16,080 --> 01:50:17,301
You? Yes.

1199
01:50:17,309 --> 01:50:18,669
Yes. Please take him out.

1200
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:00,500
Yes.

1201
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:00,230
No.

1202
01:53:02,300 --> 01:53:04,880
Hey. Are you okay?

1203
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:10,710
It's okay. Maybe some other time.

1204
01:53:17,431 --> 01:53:18,901
You can't bring you back, can we?

1205
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:24,870
You already did. You already did.

1206
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:39,090
Come on, Barry. Gotta get up.

1207
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:40,710
Come on, Barry.

1208
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:41,460
Go again.

1209
01:53:48,210 --> 01:53:52,190
So there's no point.

1210
01:54:24,090 --> 01:54:24,590
Figure it out.

1211
01:54:26,429 --> 01:54:27,629
I'm just.

1212
01:54:40,289 --> 01:54:46,939
And again.

1213
01:54:59,180 --> 01:54:59,865
Can we please just.

1214
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:01,717
Take a minute? Sorry, dude.

1215
01:55:01,730 --> 01:55:03,830
Yeah, but, bro, of course.

1216
01:55:04,371 --> 01:55:05,443
That's the whole thing.

1217
01:55:05,450 --> 01:55:07,684
We can take as much time as it takes.

1218
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:08,960
That's. That's not what I mean.

1219
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:31,620
You okay?

1220
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:33,360
You good? Come on.

1221
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:34,650
I need you in here.

1222
01:55:34,740 --> 01:55:35,520
Let's go. All right.

1223
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:36,690
Listen to me.

1224
01:55:55,220 --> 01:55:56,659
How are you? What are you.

1225
01:55:56,669 --> 01:55:58,009
Just stand here the whole time?

1226
01:55:58,971 --> 01:56:01,071
This is an inevitable intersection.

1227
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:02,270
You have to stop.

1228
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:19,420
Barry, wait.

1229
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:28,570
Hey, listen, there's something I should tell
you.

1230
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:35,097
I went back in time initially because.

1231
01:56:35,120 --> 01:56:36,290
Yeah, because Mom died.

1232
01:56:37,220 --> 01:56:39,080
How do you know? It doesn't matter.

1233
01:56:39,881 --> 01:56:40,251
It doesn't.

1234
01:56:41,179 --> 01:56:43,039
You know that I have to undo what I did.

1235
01:56:44,090 --> 01:56:45,877
No, it's not a mistake.

1236
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:48,631
We can save her and we can save them.

1237
01:56:48,650 --> 01:56:49,910
No, we can't.

1238
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:53,400
This is what Bruce was talking about, Barry.

1239
01:56:53,450 --> 01:56:57,592
This is inevitable. We can try a million
times, and we're not going to be able to fix

1240
01:56:57,620 --> 01:57:00,110
this no matter what we do.

1241
01:57:00,501 --> 01:57:02,511
This world dies.

1242
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:06,210
Today we look around.

1243
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,830
Look at the damage we're causing.

1244
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,000
Now we have to stop. Okay.

1245
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:23,370
Look, I was just doing my laundry.

1246
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:26,439
You're the one who came and told me that I'm
a superhero.

1247
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:30,150
And now you're saying what you don't want me
to be.

1248
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:31,110
Well, guess what?

1249
01:57:31,140 --> 01:57:32,370
It's too late.

1250
01:57:33,071 --> 01:57:36,331
I am the flash.

1251
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:38,670
And I can save everyone.

1252
01:57:39,149 --> 01:57:40,589
Nobody dies.

1253
01:57:43,700 --> 01:57:45,230
Not every problem has a solution.

1254
01:58:00,820 --> 01:58:01,930
Sometimes we just have to let go.

1255
01:58:04,478 --> 01:58:06,488
Let go of Mom.

1256
01:58:07,026 --> 01:58:10,626
She'll always be alive somewhere in time.

1257
01:58:11,733 --> 01:58:14,193
Always. Just not for us.

1258
01:58:15,812 --> 01:58:16,832
You're full of shit, dude.

1259
01:58:17,939 --> 01:58:18,779
I'm going back.

1260
01:58:19,108 --> 01:58:20,878
You're going back to kill Mom?

1261
01:58:21,238 --> 01:58:21,598
No.

1262
01:58:22,257 --> 01:58:23,307
You're staying.

1263
01:58:23,937 --> 01:58:24,747
You stay.

1264
01:58:25,316 --> 01:58:28,886
Right here. Just give me one more time.

1265
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:06,190
We got off on the wrong foot.

1266
01:59:06,969 --> 01:59:09,174
Let's start again. I'm the Flash.

1267
01:59:09,458 --> 01:59:10,478
What's your name?

1268
01:59:11,217 --> 01:59:14,587
Lift. More than you could dream.

1269
01:59:17,943 --> 01:59:19,383
You like breathless to.

1270
01:59:25,158 --> 01:59:27,068
Whoa, Daddy.

1271
01:59:43,030 --> 01:59:46,430
Scoring. Oh, my God.

1272
01:59:47,416 --> 01:59:49,753
So here you are.

1273
01:59:50,054 --> 01:59:52,434
Yes. And you?

1274
01:59:55,990 --> 01:59:57,310
We are so close.

1275
01:59:58,419 --> 01:59:59,619
I've got it almost figured out.

1276
02:00:00,158 --> 02:00:02,814
How long have you been doing this?

1277
02:00:03,156 --> 02:00:05,046
Time is inconsequential.

1278
02:00:05,914 --> 02:00:06,664
Come on, Barry.

1279
02:00:16,698 --> 02:00:17,018
Five.

1280
02:01:07,597 --> 02:01:08,617
The Joker would think of that.

1281
02:01:50,922 --> 02:01:51,972
This world's.

1282
02:02:01,195 --> 02:02:02,725
Colliding and collapsing.

1283
02:02:05,483 --> 02:02:06,413
We did this.

1284
02:02:08,601 --> 02:02:10,791
We're destroying the fabric of everything.

1285
02:02:13,008 --> 02:02:14,538
You have to stop.

1286
02:02:14,808 --> 02:02:16,818
Stop with the things that.

1287
02:02:19,064 --> 02:02:21,684
Is entirely your fault, Barry.

1288
02:02:22,222 --> 02:02:26,127
I pushed you out of the Chrono Ball on that
September 29th so you could start me on this

1289
02:02:26,629 --> 02:02:27,109
path.

1290
02:02:29,038 --> 02:02:30,778
How do you like this paradox?

1291
02:02:31,686 --> 02:02:33,426
I made you cream me.

1292
02:02:34,835 --> 02:02:36,335
And now you're the one.

1293
02:02:37,393 --> 02:02:41,705
In my way, no matter how close I get to
winning this fight.

1294
02:02:42,259 --> 02:02:45,687
You go back and let Mom die.

1295
02:02:46,128 --> 02:02:48,708
You're the inevitable intersection.

1296
02:02:49,457 --> 02:02:50,957
And you do have to let go.

1297
02:02:51,555 --> 02:02:52,995
What's he talking about?

1298
02:02:54,823 --> 02:02:55,723
You're my hero.

1299
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:13,881
Don't worry. It's gonna heal.

1300
02:03:14,272 --> 02:03:17,062
It's gonna heal. It is, right?

1301
02:03:33,189 --> 02:03:35,332
I know you got my.

1302
02:03:35,609 --> 02:03:36,189
My lover.

1303
02:05:02,496 --> 02:05:04,656
I used to love that cereal when I was a kid.

1304
02:05:05,404 --> 02:05:08,554
Yeah, My son goes nuts for it.

1305
02:05:13,348 --> 02:05:17,467
They stopped making it. I know they were
talking about discontinuing it.

1306
02:05:17,996 --> 02:05:20,308
I know. You know, I'm not from around here.

1307
02:05:20,606 --> 02:05:21,746
I was just visiting my mom.

1308
02:05:22,674 --> 02:05:23,683
Maybe I know her.

1309
02:05:23,813 --> 02:05:24,923
What's her name?

1310
02:05:26,112 --> 02:05:27,162
She's the best.

1311
02:05:28,319 --> 02:05:30,719
The kindest person in the world.

1312
02:05:31,088 --> 02:05:32,115
You okay? Yeah.

1313
02:05:32,248 --> 02:05:34,888
I'm just. I'm really going to miss her.

1314
02:05:56,453 --> 02:05:59,303
No, I'm just a random lady in a store.

1315
02:06:00,032 --> 02:06:01,712
I don't hack. True.

1316
02:06:09,286 --> 02:06:11,926
Oops. Sorry. Oh, don't say that.

1317
02:06:13,692 --> 02:06:16,032
Your mum must be grateful you came to visit
her.

1318
02:06:16,692 --> 02:06:18,402
She's very lucky to have you.

1319
02:06:26,695 --> 02:06:28,855
Look it up. Oh.

1320
02:06:29,284 --> 02:06:30,964
You have to tell her that.

1321
02:06:32,062 --> 02:06:33,742
Moms like to hear these kind of things.

1322
02:06:34,969 --> 02:06:43,929
Believe me.

1323
02:07:23,710 --> 02:07:25,180
Love you more.

1324
02:07:27,787 --> 02:07:28,927
Love you first.

1325
02:07:34,565 --> 02:07:36,055
Right. Bye.

1326
02:08:09,612 --> 02:08:10,532
And back.

1327
02:08:21,584 --> 02:08:23,584
Shit court.

1328
02:08:33,649 --> 02:08:35,949
The trial was initially.

1329
02:08:39,464 --> 02:08:40,214
So sorry.

1330
02:08:44,622 --> 02:08:50,813
As I was saying, the same security camera
footage, Exhibit F in the original trial was

1331
02:08:51,608 --> 02:08:58,516
initially considered useless but has now
been enhanced using the latest tech from

1332
02:08:59,403 --> 02:09:00,933
Wayne Enterprises.

1333
02:09:01,381 --> 02:09:04,569
It confirms the alibi Mr.

1334
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:09,450
Allen has argued, and his son Barry has
corroborated.

1335
02:09:10,495 --> 02:09:11,815
Since day one.

1336
02:09:18,071 --> 02:09:22,092
Here. Right here.

1337
02:09:22,609 --> 02:09:24,867
You can clearly see my client, Mr.

1338
02:09:25,158 --> 02:09:28,824
Allen, reaching for a can of tomatoes.

1339
02:09:29,295 --> 02:09:30,465
On the top shelf.

1340
02:09:47,623 --> 02:09:48,579
Uh, Mr. Allen. Mr. Allen.

1341
02:09:48,703 --> 02:09:50,908
Can you tell us a bit more about what
happened, please?

1342
02:09:51,192 --> 02:09:52,732
Well, the.

1343
02:09:53,531 --> 02:09:58,472
The tomatoes moved from the bottom shelf to
the top shelf and subsequently uncooked the

1344
02:09:59,106 --> 02:10:01,656
spaghetti, uncooked

1345
02:10:04,223 --> 02:10:05,842
I'm sorry. That makes absolutely no sense.

1346
02:10:06,051 --> 02:10:07,131
What are you talking about, sir?

1347
02:10:07,911 --> 02:10:09,381
The allegations. Thank you so much.

1348
02:10:10,100 --> 02:10:11,750
We're good here. Thank you.

1349
02:10:14,868 --> 02:10:16,168
I give a good quote. Yeah.

1350
02:10:16,427 --> 02:10:17,267
Spaghetti.

1351
02:10:18,615 --> 02:10:20,715
Hey, speaking of food, I was thinking, um.

1352
02:10:23,073 --> 02:10:24,483
You should ask me to dinner.

1353
02:10:25,361 --> 02:10:27,956
The dinner with me? Yes, A date.

1354
02:10:28,290 --> 02:10:29,697
Very Irish.

1355
02:10:29,878 --> 02:10:31,018
See you on a dinner date. Me?

1356
02:10:32,306 --> 02:10:33,626
I'd love to. Thank you.

1357
02:10:34,505 --> 02:10:37,165
Know if you also call me.

1358
02:10:46,157 --> 02:10:51,107
He said that suppress the soul presence that
made that idea.

1359
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:00,739
Bruce, congratulations.

1360
02:11:00,978 --> 02:11:01,323
Thank you.

1361
02:11:01,369 --> 02:11:03,439
You have no idea how good it is to hear your
voice.

1362
02:11:04,548 --> 02:11:06,273
I have so much to tell you the next time I
see you.

1363
02:11:06,495 --> 02:11:07,585
You were right, okay?

1364
02:11:07,726 --> 02:11:10,223
And I didn't listen. And things did get
very, very weird.

1365
02:11:10,544 --> 02:11:11,641
But I put everything back.

1366
02:11:11,783 --> 02:11:12,673
I promise.

1367
02:11:12,972 --> 02:11:16,062
I'm pulling up now. Oh, great.

1368
02:11:25,695 --> 02:11:27,765
By your own allegations.

1369
02:11:31,122 --> 02:11:32,412
Who the fuck is this?

1370
02:11:35,409 --> 02:11:37,569
Hey, Barry. No.

1371
02:11:37,847 --> 02:11:40,007
Where's your.

1372
02:11:40,285 --> 02:11:42,155
You know you can't.

1373
02:11:43,553 --> 02:11:45,303
You're not Batman.

1374
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:48,660
What's wrong with you?

1375
02:11:52,618 --> 02:11:56,648
Ah. What?
